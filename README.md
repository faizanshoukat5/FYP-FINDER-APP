FYP Supervisor Finder – Firebase Integrated Web Application
This web application simplifies and automates the coordination process among students, faculty, and administrators involved in the Final Year Project (FYP) at The University of Lahore. Users begin by registering or logging in with their email credentials, which grants them access to role-specific dashboards tailored for Students, Faculty, or Admins.

Students can explore a comprehensive list of faculty supervisors, filtering by domain expertise and availability, and submit a single project proposal per group by selecting a preferred supervisor. They can monitor the progress of their submission, receiving updates on whether their idea is pending review, accepted, rejected, or requires modifications.

Faculty members manage their profiles, update their availability, and review project proposals submitted to them. They have the authority to accept, reject, or request revisions for the ideas assigned to them.

Administrators oversee the entire system with full control—managing faculty records, monitoring project submissions, and updating statuses. They also benefit from interactive dashboards featuring visual analytics that summarize supervisor availability and project idea statuses.

Users can manage their accounts by returning to the login page to sign up or delete their accounts as needed, ensuring flexible and secure access management.
